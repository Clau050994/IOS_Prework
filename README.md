     ### App Idea: **Pocket Chef**

**Description:**  
Pocket Chef is a recipe and meal-planning app designed for people who want quick, healthy, and easy-to-cook meals. The app will help users discover new recipes, customize their meal plans, and shop efficiently.

**Features Iâ€™d Like to Implement:**
1. **Smart Recipe Search**: Users can search for recipes based on ingredients they already have at home. This reduces food waste and saves time.
2. **Meal Prep Scheduler**: Create weekly meal plans and generate grocery lists automatically based on the recipes selected.
3. **Recipe Customization**: Adjust ingredients based on serving size, dietary preferences (e.g., vegan, keto, gluten-free), or available items.
5. **Social Sharing**: Share your favorite recipes and meal plans with friends and family.

This app aims to simplify cooking, reduce decision fatigue, and promote healthier eating habits. It's perfect for busy individuals or anyone looking to explore new recipes!
